# Javascript

Documentation draft about `js`:

## File organization

All javascripts live under `/app/javascripts`
[TODO: some are still on `vendor/sprockets`]
[TODO: get rid of duplicates and unused modules]

    app/
    |-javascripts/
    |---collections/        # Backbone collections
    |---controllers/        # Backbone controllers
    |---helpers/            # Backbone helpers, shared functions between views
    |---models/             # Backbone models
    |---modules/            # Modules implemented by us
    |---vendor/             # third party modules
    |---views/              # Backbone views
    |
    |---application.js      # [Sprocket/Jammit] All our code
    |---libs.js             # [Sprocket/Jammit] Contains frameworks and third party modules.
                            # They don't change oftern so they can be cached a lot.

## Namespace

In order to avoid lots of global variables, we namespace our `js` modules under the `Teambox` namespace

    Teambox
    |-Collections  # Collection constructors
    |-Controllers  # Controller constructors
    |-Models       # Model constructors
    |-Views        # View constructors
    |
    |-collections  # collection instances
    |-controllers  # controller instances
    |-models       # model instances
    |-views        # view instances
    |
    |-modules      # our modules
    |-cache        # client side cache

## JSHint

Some options just define a coding standard, but others will help to prevent bugs / memory leaks.
If you use vim, I highly recommend using [jshint.vim](https://github.com/wookiehangover/jshint.vim)

[TODO: there are lots of globals around which can be namespaced or added to the jshint.rc file]

Recommended options.

      /*jshint prototypejs: true, browser: true, devel: true, node: true, jquery: true, debug: true,
      forin: true, undef: true, eqeqeq: true, bitwise: true, immed: true, laxbreak: true, noarg: true,
      noempty: true, nonew: true, indent: 2, maxlen: 120, onevar: true */
      /*global Teambox, _, Backbone, Templates, Handlebars, Position, Sortable */

## Coding standard

  * We will try to stick to JSHint as much as possible, but without being stupid zealots.
  * Comma-first helps to detect missing commas.
  * Private functions and variables start with `_`.
  * Adopt the **module pattern** as much as possible, it helps to avoid global namespace pollution and allows privacy.
    Declaring dependencies as local variables helps the minifiers.

  * variables are under_scored.
  * Methods are camelCased.
  * Constuctors are CamelCased, and the first letter uppercased.

Example:

``` javascript
(function () {
  var FooPrinter = function () { } // constructor
    , _config = { user: 'bla'
                , pasw: '123'
                , nested: { hey: 'ho'
                          , fleiba: 'hi'
                          }
                }
    , _printStuff = console.log    // dependency, it can be renamed by a minfier
    , _private_var = 'foo';        // private var

  FooPrinter.prototype.printFoo = function () {
    _printStuff(_private_var);
    return this;
  };

  // exports
  Teambox.modules.FooPrinter = FooPrinter;
}())

var FooPrinter = Teambox.modules.FooPrinter
  , my_printer = new FooPrinter();

  my_printer
    .printFoo(); // => foo
    .printFoo(); // => foo
```

## Templating

The templates are generated server side using trimmer + erb.
We compile them client-side using [jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade)

In order to make things easier and provide some defaults, there is a module at `app/javascripts/modules/view_compiler`
use it to generate and cache a compiler.

We are using the `self: true` option, so the only variable exposed on your views is `self`
that refers to the `locals` object you passed to the compiler.

``` javascript
// view.jade
p= self.foo
```

``` javascript
// app.js
var compiler = Teambox.modules.ViewCompiler('partials.comment_form');
console.log(compiler({foo: 'bar'}));
```

There are no _helpers_ in jade. Although you can provide some functions on the `locals` object
and they will be available. As a convention, the `view_compiler` will mixin the attributes
found at `app/javascripts/helpers/jade.js`.

You can overwrite any _helper_ by passing a local with the same name.

## Backbone, jQuery, Prototypejs and Underscore

Teambox is going through a transition period, where Prototypejs and jQuery coexist in the codebase.

The variables $ and $$ are owned by Prototypejs, and jQuery is running in noConflict mode.
The whole functionality of jQuery can be accessed with the jQuery() function (what would usually be $()).

Since Prototype is extending the DOM with objects, hybrid methods such as using Prototype methods on
jQuery selectors will work, but should be avoided.

Underscore is included and should be used for any enumerable operations, instead of Prototype.

Backbone is using jQuery, and includes the method view.$() to select elements under the main element.

All new code should be written using jQuery, and old code from Prototype should aim to remove the
dependency so it can finally depend on jQuery only.


## Testing

We use [jasmine](pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) + [phantomjs](code.google.com/p/phantomjs/) for testing.
Include your specs under `spec/javascripts/specs` and then add them manually at `spec/javascripts/SpecRunner.html`.
Try to keep the original file hierachy.
Test only one file for each spec.
Stub any AJAX call, or DOM.

[sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), [jasmine-sinon](https://github.com/froots/jasmine-sinon) and [jasmine-prototype](https://github.com/masylum/jasmine-prototype) are included.

To run the tests you must have the app http server running
Use `make test` or open `spec/javascripts/SpecRunner.html` on your browser.

## Integration tests

Integration tests can be achived easily with phantomjs.
The runner (`spec/javascripts/integration.js`) fetches
the app at http://localhost:3000.
Once the page is loaded it includes an assert library at `spec/javascripts/integration/include.js`
and execute the tests at `spec/javascripts/integration/tests.js`.

Use `make integration` to run the tests.
